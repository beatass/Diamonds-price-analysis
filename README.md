# Diamonds-price-analysis

This analysis is intented to give the answer what factors affect the price of diamonds.

## Motivation

In this study the exploratory analysis (EDA) with visualizations of diamond specifications of 56000 diamonds dataset as well as a different ML algorithms, such as XGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest have been performed to make a relevant predictions.

#### The project is created with Python libraries:

 -  scikit-learn/pandas/numpy.

### Recap







#### Running the project:

* To run this project use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## The dataset origin

The dataset can be found at Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds) and contains data about diamond specifications of 56000 diamonds which have been widely used for analysis.

## Relevant information

The dataset consists of the following features:

- price - given in US dollars ($326--$18,823);
- carat - weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01);
- cut - quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal);
- color - diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best);
- clarity - a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best));
- x - length in mm (0--10.74);
- y - width in mm (0--58.9);
- z - depth in mm (0--31.8);
- depth - total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79);
- table - width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95).
